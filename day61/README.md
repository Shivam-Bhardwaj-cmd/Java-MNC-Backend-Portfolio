# Day 61 – Dynamic Programming Fundamentals

## Topics Covered
1. **FibonacciDP** → Understanding DP via Memoization & Tabulation
2. **ClimbingStairs** → Fibonacci-based counting DP
3. **HouseRobber** → Optimized decision-based DP

## Core Concepts
- Overlapping subproblems
- Optimal substructure
- Memoization (Top-Down)
- Tabulation (Bottom-Up)

## Real-World Applications
- Resource allocation
- Path optimization
- Cost minimization & profit maximization systems

## Next Step
Day 62 → Advanced DP: "Grid-based DP (Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum, etc.)"
