# Day 63: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Variants

## Topics Covered
- LCS Recursive + Tabulation approach
- Longest Common Substring
- Application in diff tools and data synchronization

## Key Concepts
- DP Transition: dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] (if match)
- Space Optimization possible using 2 rows
- Subsequence ≠ Substring
