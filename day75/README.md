# Day 75 – Capstone: Advanced DSA Patterns Portfolio

## Objective
This project demonstrates mastery of advanced dynamic programming and DSA patterns commonly asked in MNC interviews.

## Problems Implemented
1. Maximum Product Subarray
2. Minimum Jumps to Reach End
3. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
4. Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence (referenced from Day 74)
5. Longest Bitonic Subsequence (referenced from Day 72)
6. Matrix Chain Multiplication (optional addition)

## Approach
- **Dynamic Programming:** Used for subsequence, product, and minimum jump problems.
- **Nested Loops:** Employed for state transitions in DP.
- **Space Optimization:** Can be applied to reduce memory usage in large datasets.

## Complexity
- Maximum Product Subarray: O(n) time, O(1) space
- Minimum Jumps: O(n^2) time, O(n) space
- Longest Palindromic Subsequence: O(n^2) time, O(n^2) space

## Code
See `Day75Portfolio.java` for full implementations.
