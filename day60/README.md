# Day 60 – Top Graph Interview Problems (Real-World Focus)

## Topics Covered
1. Course Schedule → Topological Sort (Cycle Detection)
2. Network Delay Time → Dijkstra’s Algorithm
3. Number of Provinces → Connected Components (DFS)
4. Clone Graph → Deep Copy using DFS/BFS

## Real-World Relevance
- **Course Schedule:** Dependency management in job scheduling systems.
- **Network Delay:** Network latency analysis and message propagation.
- **Number of Provinces:** Finding isolated systems in distributed networks.
- **Clone Graph:** Used in caching, serialization, and graph-based object cloning.

## Difficulty Level
🔹 Intermediate–Advanced  
🔹 Common in FAANG and Product-based MNC interviews
