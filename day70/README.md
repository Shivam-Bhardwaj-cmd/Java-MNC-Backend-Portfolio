# Day 70 - Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

**Topic:** Dynamic Programming

**Description:**
Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) is the problem of finding the length of the longest subsequence in an array such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in strictly increasing order.

**Implemented Approaches:**
1. Dynamic Programming (O(n^2))
2. Binary Search optimized approach (O(n log n))

**Key Concepts:**
- Dynamic Programming
- Binary Search
- Subsequence vs Subarray
- Optimal Substructure

**Time Complexity:**
- DP: O(n^2)
- Binary Search: O(n log n)

**Space Complexity:**
- DP: O(n)
- Binary Search: O(n)
