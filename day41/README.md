# Day 41 - Graph Advanced Algorithms

## Topics Covered

1. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
   - Shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs (handles negative weights)
   - Detects negative weight cycles
   - `BellmanFordDemo.java`

2. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**
   - Computes shortest paths between all pairs of vertices
   - Dynamic programming approach
   - `FloydWarshallDemo.java`

3. **Connected Components in Undirected Graph**
   - Counts the number of connected components
   - Uses DFS
   - `ConnectedComponentsUndirectedDemo.java`

4. **Graph Representation**
   - Adjacency List
   - Adjacency Matrix
   - `GraphRepresentationDemo.java`

## Key Points
- Understand the difference between single-source shortest path (Bellman-Ford) and all-pairs shortest path (Floyd-Warshall).  
- DFS is useful for exploring graphs and finding connected components.  
- Graph representation affects the efficiency of algorithms.
