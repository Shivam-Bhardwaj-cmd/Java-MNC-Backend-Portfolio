# Day 71 - Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence (MSIS)

**Topic:** Dynamic Programming

**Description:**
Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence (MSIS) is the problem of finding the sum of the maximum-sum subsequence of an array such that all elements of the subsequence are strictly increasing.

**Implemented Approach:**
- Dynamic Programming (O(n^2) time, O(n) space)

**Key Concepts:**
- Dynamic Programming
- Subsequence vs Subarray
- Optimal Substructure

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)
