echo "# Day 14 – Two Pointer Technique (Level 1)

### 🎯 Objective
Learned how to use **two pointers** to efficiently solve array and string problems without nested loops.

---

### 🧩 Problems Covered
1. **Reverse an Array** – Swap start and end elements until pointers meet.
2. **Pair with Given Sum (Sorted Array)** – Move left/right pointers based on sum comparison.
3. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array** – Maintain unique elements in-place using slow and fast pointers.

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Two-pointer reduces O(n²) to O(n) in many array problems.
- Works best with **sorted data** or when there’s **a clear direction to move**.
- Core pattern reused in sliding window, linked list, and binary search problems.

---

### 📊 Complexity Overview
| Problem | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Reverse Array | O(n) | O(1) |
| Pair with Sum | O(n) | O(1) |
| Remove Duplicates | O(n) | O(1) |
