# Day 30 – Recursion + Backtracking Basics

### 🔍 Overview
This day marks the transition from simple recursion to **Backtracking**, where we explore **all possible solutions** by building and unbuilding recursive states.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

1. **RecursionBasics.java**
   - Print numbers from 1 to N using recursion.
   - Compute factorial recursively.
   - Understand recursion stack and base condition.

2. **SubsetsBacktracking.java**
   - Generate all subsets (power set) of a given array.
   - Introduces the concept of **decision tree exploration**.

3. **PermutationsBacktracking.java**
   - Generate all permutations of an array.
   - Learn **choose–explore–unchoose** pattern.

4. **RatInMaze.java**
   - Classic backtracking pathfinding problem.
   - Shows recursive exploration with **safe path checking** and **backtracking**.

---

### 🧠 Learning Outcome
- Understanding of recursion tree structure.
- Confidence with base cases and backtracking.
- Foundation for solving **combinatorial, pathfinding, and constraint-based problems**.
