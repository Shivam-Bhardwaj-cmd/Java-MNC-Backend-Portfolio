        Applications of Strongly Connected Components (SCCs):

        1️⃣ Detecting Circular Dependencies (e.g., in microservices or compilers)
        2️⃣ Finding strongly connected subsystems in distributed systems
        3️⃣ Solving problems like:
            - Course Schedule (Leetcode 207)
            - Safe States in Graph (Leetcode 802)
            - Eventual Safe Nodes
        4️⃣ Component compression in DAGs for efficient system modeling
