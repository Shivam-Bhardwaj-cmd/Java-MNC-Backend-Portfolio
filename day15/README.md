echo "# Day 15 – Sliding Window Technique (Level 1)

### 🎯 Objective
Learned how to use the **Sliding Window Technique** to efficiently process subarrays of fixed size, reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

---

### 🧩 Problems Covered
1. **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K** – Maintain current window sum dynamically.
2. **First Negative Number in Every Window of Size K** – Use queue to track negatives efficiently.
3. **Count of Subarrays with Given Average (Fixed Window)** – Apply sliding window to count valid averages.

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Sliding window is powerful for fixed-size subarray/substring operations.
- Helps in handling sum, count, or property-based problems efficiently.
- Builds foundation for variable-size window and string pattern problems.

---

### 📊 Complexity Overview
| Problem | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Max Sum Subarray | O(n) | O(1) |
| First Negative in Window | O(n) | O(k) |
| Count with Given Average | O(n) | O(1) |
