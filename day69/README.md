# Day 69 - Matrix Chain Multiplication

**Topic:** Dynamic Programming

**Description:**
Matrix Chain Multiplication problem is to find the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply a given sequence of matrices. The goal is to determine the optimal order of multiplying matrices to minimize computations.

**Implemented Approaches:**
1. Recursive solution
2. Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up) solution

**Key Concepts:**
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- Optimal substructure
- Overlapping subproblems

**Time Complexity:**
- Recursive: Exponential (O(2^n))
- DP: O(n^3)

**Space Complexity:**
- Recursive: O(n) (stack space)
- DP: O(n^2)
