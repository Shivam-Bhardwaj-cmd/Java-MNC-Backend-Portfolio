# Day 31 – Advanced Backtracking Problems

## Overview
This day focuses on **classic backtracking problems** frequently asked in MNC interviews.  
We explore **constraint-based problem solving** using recursion + backtracking.

## Programs

1. **NQueensDemo.java**
   - Solve the N-Queens problem.
   - Place N queens on an N×N chessboard without conflicts.

2. **SudokuSolverDemo.java**
   - Solve 9×9 Sudoku boards using backtracking.
   - Fills empty cells ensuring rows, columns, and subgrids have unique digits.

3. **WordSearchDemo.java**
   - Search for a word in a 2D grid.
   - Recursively checks all possible paths with backtracking.

## Learning Outcomes
- Deepen understanding of **choose → explore → un-choose** backtracking pattern.
- Solve real combinatorial problems.
- Strengthen recursion intuition for MNC-level coding interviews.
