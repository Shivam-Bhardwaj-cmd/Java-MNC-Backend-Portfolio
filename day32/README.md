# Day 32 – Backtracking & Combinatorial Problems (Medium Level)

## Overview
This day focuses on **medium-level combinatorial backtracking problems**, frequently asked in MNC interviews.

## Programs

1. **CombinationSumDemo.java**
   - Finds all combinations of numbers that sum up to a target.
   - Numbers can be reused multiple times.
   - Demonstrates **choose → explore → unchoose** pattern.

2. **SubsetsWithDupDemo.java**
   - Generates all unique subsets from an array with duplicates.
   - Handles skipping duplicates to avoid repeated subsets.

3. **PalindromePartitioningDemo.java**
   - Finds all possible palindrome partitions of a string.
   - Combines **string recursion** and **backtracking**.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand backtracking with constraints.
- Handle duplicates in combinatorial problems.
- Apply recursion effectively for string and array problems.

### Next Step
Move to **Day 33–34** for **advanced backtracking with grids and N-Queens variants**, then transition to **Trees & Graphs**.
