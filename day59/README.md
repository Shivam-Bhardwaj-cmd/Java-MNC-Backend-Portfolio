# Day 59 – Graph Cycle Detection (Directed & Undirected)

## Concepts Covered:
- Cycle detection in directed graphs using DFS and recursion stack
- Cycle detection in undirected graphs using DFS and parent tracking
- Use-cases: dependency resolution, deadlock detection, topological sorting

## Key Takeaways:
- Directed graphs → recursion stack method
- Undirected graphs → parent check method
- Union-Find can also be used (alternative)
