# Day 43 - Advanced Graph Algorithms: Shortest Paths

## Topics Covered

1. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
   - Single-source shortest path
   - Handles negative weight edges
   - Detects negative cycles

2. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**
   - All-pairs shortest path
   - Dynamic programming approach

3. **All-Pairs Shortest Path using Multiple Dijkstra**
   - Efficient for sparse graphs
   - Demonstrates multiple Dijkstra runs for all vertices

## Key Points
- Bellman-Ford is essential when negative weights exist.
- Floyd-Warshall is DP-based and simple for dense graphs.
- Multi-Dijkstra approach is faster for sparse graphs.
