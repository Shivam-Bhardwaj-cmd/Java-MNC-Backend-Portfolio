# Day 28 — Advanced Stack & Queue Patterns

### Topics Covered:
- Monotonic Stack pattern
- Next Greater Element in Circular Array
- Sliding Window Maximum using Deque

### Files:
1. MonotonicStackDemo.java — Demonstrates the monotonic stack concept.
2. NextGreaterElementCircularDemo.java — Solves circular NGE problem.
3. SlidingWindowMaximumDemo.java — Computes max in each window using deque.

### Key Concepts:
- Stack optimization for linear-time solutions.
- Circular array processing.
- Deque as a double-ended queue for efficient window operations.
