# 📘 Day 4 – Array Statistics (ArrayStatsDemo.java)

### 🎯 Objective
To understand **array traversal and aggregation** in Java by building a real-world style program that calculates statistical information about a given integer array.

---

### 🧩 Concepts Covered
- Array traversal using loops  
- Aggregation (sum, average)  
- Finding minimum and maximum elements  
- Counting even and odd numbers  
- Time & Space complexity analysis

---

### 💻 File
`ArrayStatsDemo.java`

### 📦 Package
`com.dsa.day4`

---

### 🧠 Code Overview
The program processes an integer array and calculates:
- Total elements
- Sum
- Average
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Even count
- Odd count

This demonstrates real-world backend data analysis logic using basic array operations.
