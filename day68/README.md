# Day 68: Dynamic Programming – Longest Increasing Subsequence & Variants

## Overview
This day focuses on Dynamic Programming techniques to solve the **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** and related problems:

1. LIS using Bottom-Up DP
2. LIS using Recursion
3. Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence (MSIS)
4. Maximum Sum Subsequence Variant
5. Counting Number of Longest Increasing Subsequences

## Files
- `LISBottomUpDP.java` – LIS using Bottom-Up DP
- `LISRecursive.java` – LIS using recursion
- `MSIS.java` – Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence
- `MaxSumSubsequence.java` – Variant of MSIS
- `NumberOfLIS.java` – Count the number of LIS in an array

## Usage
Each Java file contains a `main()` method and can be run independently.

```bash
# Compile
javac LISBottomUpDP.java

# Run
java LISBottomUpDP
