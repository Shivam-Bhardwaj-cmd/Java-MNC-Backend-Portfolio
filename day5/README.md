# 🔍 Day 5 – Searching Algorithms (Linear Search & Binary Search)

### 🎯 Objective
To understand and implement **searching algorithms** that help in locating elements efficiently within datasets — a key skill in backend and data structure optimization.

---

### 🧩 Concepts Covered
- **Linear Search (Sequential Search)**  
  - Works on *unsorted arrays*
  - Checks elements one-by-one
- **Binary Search (Divide & Conquer)**  
  - Works only on *sorted arrays*
  - Reduces search space by half in every iteration

### 🧠 Linear Search Overview
```java
int[] data = {15, 8, 23, 4, 42, 16};
int target = 23;
