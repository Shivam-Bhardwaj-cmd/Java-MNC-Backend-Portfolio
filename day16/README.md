echo "# Day 16 – Sliding Window Technique (Level 2: Variable Window)

### 🎯 Objective
Learned how to apply **variable-size sliding windows** to handle subarray or substring problems where the window expands and shrinks dynamically based on a condition.

---

### 🧩 Problems Covered
1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** – Dynamic window using HashSet.  
2. **Smallest Subarray With Given Sum** – Expand/shrink window based on cumulative sum.  
3. **Longest Subarray With Sum ≤ K** – Maintain longest valid window respecting constraint.

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Variable window = flexibility to expand or shrink dynamically.
- Used for string, array, and sum-based problems.
- Foundation for complex FAANG-level sliding window problems.

### 📊 Complexity Overview
| Problem | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Longest Substring (Unique) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Smallest Subarray (Sum ≥ K) | O(n) | O(1) |
| Longest Subarray (Sum ≤ K) | O(n) | O(1) |
